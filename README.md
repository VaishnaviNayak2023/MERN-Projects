# MERN-Projects
A full-stack web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It demonstrates end-to-end development with a modern JavaScript tech stack — including a dynamic frontend, RESTful API backend, and a NoSQL database.
The project follows clean architecture principles, secure authentication, and responsive design to deliver a complete, production-ready experience.

🚀 Key Highlights:

Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js

MongoDB database with Mongoose ORM

React frontend with reusable components and hooks

JWT-based authentication and role management

Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS / Material UI

Deployed on Render / Vercel / Netlify for live demo

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT, bcrypt

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
